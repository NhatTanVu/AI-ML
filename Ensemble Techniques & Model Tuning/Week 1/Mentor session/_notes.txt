Decision Tree
	- look for binary split
	- old technique, for benchmarking
	- find most important features
	- could memorize but could be overfit, thus could not generalize
	- give bins to data
	- effective for small data, < 1 million rows
entropy
	- a measure of uncertainty
imbalances in classes => need to combine values to balance the classes out
(train% - test%) > 10% => overfitting
