Feature engineering
	Use domain knowledge to create features
	Problem -> Collect data -> Algorithm -> Predict
		Don't have time to collect data -> Use existing data
	Find the most important features
Tuning model
	More empirical than theoretical
{Ridge & Lasso + Polynominal features} mostly help for regression, not classification
Drop variables that has high correlation
RandomForestClassifier -> n_jobs
