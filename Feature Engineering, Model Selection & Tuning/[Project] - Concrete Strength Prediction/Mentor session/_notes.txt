MAPE = Mean Absolute Percentage Error
	=> On average, how many percentage of your predictions are off from the target values
Residual plot function
	yellow brick library
	help(ResidualsPlot)
	Fan shape => Hard to predict outliers
	Dots grouped in diagonal lines => Many clusters
	Residuals should be in normal distribution, variance is consistent, no stratas in residuals
Gradient Boosting Regressor works well
Normalize right skewed fields by np.log()
Scale doesn't improve tree-based models, but can improve linear models
Bayesian Optimization ???
Mean squared error >< R2 squared error ???
Can use cross-validation for measuring 95% confidence interval
