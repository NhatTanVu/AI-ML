- Max AUC/ROC-f1 score, Min gap between training & small dataset
=> More features, more layers
=> Acc heavily-weighted on true-negative

- Install H2O
	for 3.6:
	conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda
	source activate py36
	conda config --append channels conda-forge
	conda install -c h2oai h2o
	for 3.7: conda install -c h2oai h2o
- Dropout => regularization, reducing gap
- TensorBoard
- NN => Non-linear => Don't care much about correlation
- Split -> Scale
- Single-squared bracket => Create Series
- Double-squared bracket => Create DataFrames
- Keras Callback EarlyStopping
- Next NN layers usually have less number of nodes than previous ones
