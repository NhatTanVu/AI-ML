ordinal data
	increment number
"odds"
	=> probability
	=> P/(1-P)
	=> ln(P/(1-P))
1 dependent variable is a logit
find decision boundary = logistic regression
>0.7 => strong correlation => drop 1
coefficient ???
imbalance classes = output 80/20 
	=> need to preprocess
need features with more variability
Pseudo R-squ. => variability of model
don't convert category to continuous variables
